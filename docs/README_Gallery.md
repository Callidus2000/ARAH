#  Dracoon Powershell Module

This Powershell Module is a generic wrapper/helper for REST APIs.

## Detailed Information for this Module
- [Project Homepage @github](https://github.com/Callidus2000/ARAH)
- [Report Bug](https://github.com/Callidus2000/ARAH/issues)
- [Request Feature](https://github.com/Callidus2000/ARAH/issues)

## Installation

The releases are published in the Powershell Gallery, therefor it is quite simple:
  ```powershell
  Install-Module ARAH -Force -AllowClobber
  ```
The `AllowClobber` option is currently neccessary because of an issue in the current PowerShellGet module. Hopefully it will not be needed in the future any more.
